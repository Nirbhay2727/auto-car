COL333 ASSIGNMENT 3 REPORT

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

1.Given sensor information of a car, determine position of other cars on the grid.

2.Given a sensor information of a car and its goal positions, determine the optimal move.


ESTIMATOR

Key Idea - We apply particle filtering algorithm with 2000 particles

When given observation variables that is sensor data , a particle filter seeks to estimate the posterior density of the state variables that is the belief. 
In a hidden Markov Model, both hidden and visible variables, the particle filter is created. The hidden variables (state-process) and the observable variables (observation process) are connected by a known functional form.
Using the observation measurement process, we calculate the posterior distribution of the other states and normalise its values.


INTELLIGENT DRIVER

Key Idea - Based on the information we have of the grid world we will decide next move. 

We first estimate the goal position we want to go towards, this is significant in case of multiple goals.
Now we shall decide our next move based on our goal position and the type of squares in the vicinity
Now given the current belief about where other cars are and a graph of how, w then chose a next node to drive towards.

TESTING: 
Estimator accurately determines the belief of the stdCars. As can be seen visually in debug mode.
Intelligent Driver works successfully for small and lombard layouts upto numerous cars.
