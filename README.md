# AI-driven Autonomous Car Simulator
- Developed a probabilistic tracking model using particle filtering to estimate car locations using a noisy sensor.
- Employed forecasting methods based on calculated transition probabilities to design a dynamic safe path planner.
- Improved tracking accuracy 10x and achieved a 60 per cent higher goal completion rate compared to the base model.
